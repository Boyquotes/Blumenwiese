A little experiment in 3D using the Godot Engine

A while ago, I created a 2D platformer in Godot - not really a game, just an experiment.

This is my first attempt on 3D with Godot.

I also experimented with Dreams on the PS4, which is wonderful, but OTOH sometimes I really miss the ability to just code there - instead, in Dreams you have to create "circuits" and connect them with "wires". That makes programming logic complicated.

So I returned to the Godot Engine and right now I'm learning how to develop 3D with Godot.

Godot technique I am using here sofar:

- Importing assets (the robot from one of the demo projects)
- GDScript basics
- Using a KinematicBody and controlling it with the keyboard
- This includes physics - and a little bit of vector/matrix math
- Creating primtive meshes from scratch
- Using a MultiMeshInstance and using code to place the instances
- Material
- Using a shader to let a quad mesh look like a disc
- Converting a SpatialMaterial to a ShaderMaterial (which generates shader code)
- Add my own little code to this code in the right place

I'm going to try other things out, one by one.
